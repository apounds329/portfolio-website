Not all those who wander are lost".  I'm proof!  A born and bred <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/florida.jpeg" data-fx="1">South Floridian</a>, I was always interested in art, literature, and history from a young age. I wanted to be a <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/40.jpg" data-fx="2">Disney animator</a> or <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/indy.jpeg" data-fx="3">Indiana Jones</a> (naturally).
I attended film school at <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/36.jpg" data-fx="4">University of Central Florida</a>and graduated with a degree in Psychology, always maintaining a strong passion for understanding motivations behind the human condition. These motivations create the intricate stories and experiences we all desire to relate to.
In 2021, I obtained a <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/CF.jpg" data-fx="16">UX certificate</a>with CareerFoundry and completed a specialization in frontend development.
I believe a person can live 1,000 lives in a lifetime, and I'm getting there! (Barista, <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/serving.jpeg" data-fx="9">server</a>, librarian,<a class="content__text-link"  data-img="img/lifeguard.jpeg" data-fx="11">lifeguard</a>, and currently a<a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/sx1.jpeg,img/teeth.jpeg,img/sx2.jpeg" data-fx="14">veterinary nurse.</a> There is one common thread stiching my life quilt together: <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/34.jpg" data-fx="5">people!</a>
I have learned to engage with a myriad of people & systems within the service industry, educational institutions, and medical establishments. Drawing from past and current experiences, I
consider myself a technological medium.  With users as my guides, I use their feedback combined with the <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/diagram.png" data-fx="6">design thinking process</a>to solve problems based on people's needs.  I love
creating unique visual experiences that just work. I believe the charm of UX design can be found in the close embrace of ethnographic studies and visual communication. Immersing yourself in another culture,
identity, or situation provides severe empathy and invaluable perspective to product creation. This is the core of user experience design: the life experiences (& I’ve had a lot!).  I hope to create work that educates, excites,
and unites on a global scale.  Jack of all trades, master of UX.

I've got lots of<a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/dogs.jpeg" data-fx="6">these</a>and<a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/guineas.jpeg" data-fx="7">these</a>.<br>
I love to <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/brazil.jpeg,img/greece2.jpeg,img/nz.jpeg,img/mexico.jpeg" data-fx="14">travel</a> and practice all styles of hot yoga (8 years and counthing).

You can create the <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/30.jpg" data-fx="7">world</a> you want to see and be a part of. You have that <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/28.jpg" data-fx="8">power</a>. Don't forget to tell these special <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/26.jpg" data-fx="9">people</a> in your life just how special they are to <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/24.jpg" data-fx="10">you</a>. Let's build an almighty <a class="content__text-link"  data-img="img/22.jpg" data-fx="11">mountain</a>. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty <a class="content__text-link"  data-img="img/5.jpg" data-fx="12">tree</a> that fast? The only <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/20.jpg" data-fx="13">prerequisite</a> is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

This is your <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/18.jpg,img/16.jpg,img/14.jpg" data-fx="14">creation</a> - and it's just as unique and <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/12.jpg" data-fx="15">special</a> as you are. Decide where your <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/3.jpg" data-fx="16">cloud</a> lives. Maybe he lives right in <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/2.jpg" data-fx="17">here</a>. You have to make those little <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/1.jpg" data-fx="18">noises</a> or it won't <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/41.jpg" data-fx="19">work</a>. Just go <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/33.jpg" data-fx="20">out</a> and talk to a tree. Make <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/39.jpg" data-fx="21">friends</a> with it. This is <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/37.jpg" data-fx="22">truly</a> an almighty <a class="content__text-link" data-img="img/35.jpg" data-fx="23">mountain</a>.

As a restaurant server turned veterinary nurse turned designer, I understand the value of dedicating myself to the service of people (even the furry, 4 legged ones).  I strive to understand and help people in an intelligent, thoughtful way while staying true to my creative nature.  The same principles of adocacy and empathy apply in user expereince design: the user is always front and center.</p>
